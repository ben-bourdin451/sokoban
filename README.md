# Sokoban
Very old game I built originally in C when I was 14 as an exercise for an [online tutorial.](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/19980-apprenez-a-programmer-en-c/18709-tp-mario-sokoban)

I rebuilt it in JS a few years later.

Now it's using a canvas & webpack to minify & load assets.

## Run

Simply run `npm start` to start webpack dev server and server files to `localhost:8080`. Auto-reload is enabled by default

## Build

`npm run build` will produce final assets into the `docs` folder for hosting on github
